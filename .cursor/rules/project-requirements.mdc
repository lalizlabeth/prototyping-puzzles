# What is this project?
This repository is a series of puzzles for "Prototyping with Cursor". The goal is to help students learn how to make things look "not ugly".

# Project structure
- All code is in the `app/` folder
- The main working directory for all prototypes is the `app/prototypes` folder
- Each prototype lives in its own dedicated folder within `/app/prototypes`
- Each prototype functions as an independent entity (unless specifically noted otherwise)
- Each prototype can use its own tech stack and dependencies as needed
- Each prototype should include its own README.md with setup instructions

# Student context:
- Students come from diverse technical backgrounds
  - Some are first-time coders with no command line experience
  - Others may have front-end development experience
- Most students are product designers and UX designers
- Students will be learning to use Cursor AI to assist with their prototyping process

# Important considerations:
- Assume varying levels of technical expertise
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions when needed
- Each prototype should be treated as its own standalone project
- Documentation should be beginner-friendly
- Code comments should be descriptive and educational

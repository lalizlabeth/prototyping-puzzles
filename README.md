# Prototyping puzzles

This repository contains a series of puzzles designed to help you learn how to communicate visual design changes using Cursor AI. The goal is to help you practice making things look "not ugly" by effectively describing design improvements to AI.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How the puzzles work

Each puzzle presents you with a basic, functional prototype that needs visual improvements. Your task is to:

1. Review the puzzle's README for specific requirements
2. Examine the current implementation
3. Practice communicating design improvements to Cursor AI
4. Implement the changes using Cursor's suggestions
5. Reflect on the effectiveness of your communication


## Tips for communicating design changes

When asking Cursor to help improve the visual design:

1. Be specific about what aspects need improvement
2. Use clear design terminology
3. Reference specific elements and their relationships
4. Provide context about the desired look and feel
5. Break down complex changes into smaller steps

```
Could you help improve the visual hierarchy of this card component by:
1. Adding more breathing room between elements
2. Making the title more prominent
3. Softening the contrast of secondary text
